      <p>I am a junior software developer with a particular interest and knack for front-end. I love working on all facets of technology and programming, but I am especially fascinated when I can use my web development skills to build software and applications that are beautiful, meaningful, and impactful.</p>
      <p>Beginning at an early age, I have always been interested in building things. As a child, I was fascinated by Legos which helped spawn my interest in architecture and the built environment. This led me to a career as a project engineer in the construction industry, helping shape the spaces that we interact and live in. After several years working in the industry, I felt I needed a change as I wanted the work that I did to have a greater impact on peopleâ€™s lives. I saw coding as an outlet to build beautiful applications that could reach a wider audience and I found the creative and logical reasoning behind it to be extremely rewarding.</p>
      <p>I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp, a 19-week, immersive coding program that teaches full stack web development, agile project management, and engineering empathy.</p>
      <p>I bring with me from my previous experience a successful track record of managing multiple projects concurrently and coordinating cross-functional teams. If you are looking for a developer that is not only an adept programmer, but also believes that technology can be beautiful, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.</p>
