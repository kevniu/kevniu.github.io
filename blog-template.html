<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a good experience to compare wireframes and see the reasons why your pair decided on a placement of certain elements and the thoughts they had regarding navigation around the page. The HTML code was pretty similar, so it was good to discuss how to use specific syntax to make the page look a certain way.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, it helped to plan out where my elements were going to be on the page and provided a sort of rough draft to writing out the HTML code.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We thought that a good wireframe gives a general visual representation of what the webpage layout might look like on the computer screen, with the elements in their approximate locations and determining how to naviagte around the site.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
New semantic elements I learned were navigation, section, and article. These new tags help organize text in a logical fashion.
