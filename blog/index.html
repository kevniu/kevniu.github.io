    <a class="blogtitle-link" href="http://kevniu.github.io/blog/javascript.html">Introduction to Recursion</a>
    <p>Recursion is an awesome programming tool. It provides a simple and powerful way to approach many problems. A basic definition of recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. This definition probably isn't the most helpful so let's take a look at the movie Inception to gain a general understanding of the concept. In the movie, Cobb (Leo's character) and his team enter someone's dream to incept an idea into their subconscious. If they feel like they are not deep enough inside the person's subconscious, they enter a person's dream within a dream. And will continue to enter a dream within a dream until they are deep enough inside the subconcious to accomplish their goal. This is the general idea behind recursion.

    <a class="blogtitle-link" href="http://kevniu.github.io/blog/javascript.html">JavaScript Objects Literals vs. Ruby Hashes</a>
    <p>After spending the last three weeks getting to know Ruby, this week we got our introduction to JavaScript. The languages themselves are fairly similar in that they both use object-oriented programming. So when I first started reading up on Javascript, I was a bit surprised to learn that it didn't include a very handy and powerful data type present in Ruby - hashes. I quickly figured out that Javascript has a very similar feature that works in much the same way called object literals.

    <a class="blogtitle-link" href="http://kevniu.github.io/blog/ruby-classes.html">Introduction to Ruby Classes</a>
    <p>Ruby is an object-oriented programming language meaning that much of it centers around defining and manipulating objects. Sometimes we may want to categorize objects to more easily identify them. We do this by creating classes. Classes can be thought of as the blueprint from which individual objects are created.</p>

    <p>This week we learned about and worked with Enumerables, I decided to write this post on the Enumerable method <code>cycle</code> as I have not used it before and thought it would be a good opportunity to learn more about it. To get started, let's talk a bit about what enumerables are. Enumerables provide collection classes such as arrays and hashes with methods to traverse, search through, and sort.</p>

    <a class="blogtitle-link" href="http://kevniu.github.io/blog/arrays-hashes.html">Arrays and Hashes</a>
    <p>This week we started delving into Ruby at DBC, it's been awhile for me since I looked at Ruby material so it's been a great refresher. This blog post aims to introduce the concepts of arrays and hashes and looks at the differences between the two. To get us started, arrays and hashes are easily thought of as collections used to store and retrieve or look up data.</p>

    <a class="blogtitle-link" href="http://kevniu.github.io/blog/css-concepts.html">Positioning with CSS</a>
    <p>This week we began tinkering with CSS; the most difficult and by far the frustrating aspect for me of CSS is trying to understand how positioning works so I'm going to try to explain it here in this blog post. There are four different types of position values: <b>static</b>, <b>fixed</b>, <b>relative</b>, and <b>absolute</b>. Let's start off with the easiest position to understand which would be the default position of <b>static</b>. These elements simply stack in a standard one-after-another order the same way they are ordered in your code. So whatever comes first in your code will be displayed first closer to the top of the page and so on so forth.</p>

    <a class="blogtitle-link" href="http://kevniu.github.io/blog/git.html" >Getting Acquanited with Git and GitHub</a>
    <p>The most important concepts we learned this week were version control and how Git and GitHub works, all super handy tools. Version control keeps track of your files and all the changes you've made and when you made them. So if you screw up, you can just go back to an earlier version of the file before things started going downhill. These different saved versions of your file are called a commit; you can think of them as a snapshot in time of your code. A good analogy, would be a checkpoint in a video game, if you die or fail in the middle of a video game, you can just go back to your last save point or in our case the last commit and proceed from there.</p>
