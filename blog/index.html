    <h2>Positiong with CSS<h2>
    <h4>February 5, 2016</h4>
    <p>This week we began tinkering with CSS; the most difficult and by far the frustrating aspect for me of CSS is trying to understand how positioning works so I'm going to try to explain it here in this blog post. There are four different types of position values: <b>static</b>, <b>fixed</b>, <b>relative</b>, and <b>absolute</b>. Let's start off with the easiest position to understand which would be the default position of <b>static</b>. These elements simply stack in a standard one-after-another order the same way they are ordered in your code. So whatever comes first in your code will be displayed first closer to the top of the page and so on so forth.</p>

    <h2>Getting Acquainted with Git and GitHub<h2>
    <h4>January 21, 2016</h4>
    <p>The most important concepts we learned this week were version control and how Git and GitHub works, all super handy tools. Version control keeps track of your files and all the changes you've made and when you made them. So if you screw up, you can just go back to an earlier version of the file before things started going downhill. These different saved versions of your file are called a commit; you can think of them as a snapshot in time of your code. A good analogy, would be a checkpoint in a video game, if you die or fail in the middle of a video game, you can just go back to your last save point or in our case the last commit and proceed from there.</p>
