    <h2>Enumerables: The Cycle Method</h2>
    <h4>February 19, 2016</h4>
      <p>
        This week we learned about and worked with Enumerables, I decided to write this post on the Enumerable method <code>cycle</code> as I have not used it before and thought it would be a good opportunity to learn more about it. To get started, let's talk a bit about what enumerables are. Enumerables provide collection classes such as arrays and hashes with methods to traverse, search through, and sort.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>cycle</code> method that we will be taking a closer look at here, allows you to cycle through each element in a collection repeatedly and in order for a specified number of times or forever if no limit is provided. It passes each element in your array into the code block and then starts over again at the beginning of the array once the last item has been passed to the block. The code below shows the syntax of the <code>cycle</code> method with a general example.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>

            a = ["a", "b", "c"]
            a.cycle { |x| puts x }  # print: a, b, c, a, b, c,.. forever.
            a.cycle(2) { |x| puts x }  # print array 2 times: a, b, c, a, b, c.

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Here we have another example using days of the week. We can also break out of the infinite cycle if we encounter a break statement in the code block as shown below.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>

          days_of_week = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday",
          "Saturday", "Sunday"]

          days_of_week.cycle {|d| puts d}
          =>  Monday
              Tuesday
              Wednnesday
              Thursday
              Friday
              Saturday
              Sunday
              Monday
              Tuesday
              ...
          # Since no limit was indicated, it goes on forever
          # Typing Ctrl+C on the command line will stop the cycle

          days_of_week.cycle do |d|
            puts d
            break if d == "Thursday"
          end
          =>  Monday
              Tuesday
              Wednesday
              Thursday
          =>  nil
          # Breaks cycle when Thursday is reached

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        If no code block is included, the <code>cycle</code> method will return an enumerator. This is useful for when you would like to create an object that spits out the next item in a repeating, ordered sequence. Using the same array as the example above, we can see how the <code>next</code> method works to give us the following day of the week.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>

          days = days.cycle
          # Returns an enumerator

          days.next
          =>  Monday
          days.next
          =>  Tuesday
          days.next
          =>  Wednesday

          days.rewind
          # The rewind method "rewinds" the enumerator back to the first item

          days.next
          =>  Monday

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        And that's it! Not too bad right? Hope you found this as a nice tutorial to using the cycle method.
