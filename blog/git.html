    <h2>Getting Acquainted with Git and GitHub</h2>

        This week marked the start of phase 0. The most important concepts we learned were version control and how Git and GitHub works, which I will touch upon below. Version control keeps track of your files and all the changes you've made and when you made them. So if you screw up, you can just go back to an earlier version of the file before things started going downhill. These different saved versions of your file are called a commit; you can think of them as a snapshot in time of your code. Developers use version control to track changes in their code; it becomes much more useful when you work on the same files with other collaborators. Instead of sending files to one another, teams can do something called a merge that combines commits by different users into one complete file. Team memmbers can work on different parts of the code without stepping on each others' toes and overwriting each others' code.

        This brings us to the topic of Git which is one of the most popular version control systems available. Git is a free, local software that tracks the files and folders of a project's lifecycle. It lets you create branch structures where you work on you code without affecting the "master" version. Once you are happy with your code, you can then merge the new branch back to the master. This branch structure allows multiple users to easily work on the same project and merge their changes into the master. Git will also track all the commits that you made throughout your coding process so you have different snapshots in time of your code to fall back on if any issues come up.

        We can't talk about Git without also mentioning GitHub. These two terms are easily confused with one another but they are actually two different things. GitHub is a popular website that allows us to store our local Git projects in a remote location online so that other users can collaborate and help manage the same files. The benefit of storing your files on GitHub is that it acts as the central repository to keep your whole team in sync. When you commit your changes to GitHub, other develoeprs can pull the changes to their local repositories and vice versa; making it an invaluable tool.
