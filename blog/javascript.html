    <h1>JavaScript Objects Literals vs. Ruby Hashes</h1>
    <p class="date">March 1, 2016</p>
      <p>
        After spending the last three weeks getting to know Ruby, this week we got our introduction to JavaScript. The languages themselves are fairly similar in that they both use object-oriented programming. So when I first started reading up on Javascript, I was a bit surprised to learn that it didn't include a very handy and powerful data type present in Ruby - hashes. I quickly figured out that Javascript has a very similar feature that works in much the same way called object literals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both an object literal and hash are used as data structures to contain a collection of values. In JavaScript, objects are comprised of properties that have an associated value. In Ruby hashes, the aforementioned properties are referred to as keys. And just like properties, keys have an associated value corresponding to them. One important distinction is that JavaScript object properties can only be variables while Ruby hash keys can be any data type. But both properties and keys can point to any type of data value. Below are two code blocks: one showing how to delcare, access, and modify a JavaScript object literal and one for Ruby hash literal.
      </p>
      <p><em>JavaScript Object Literal:</em></p>
      <pre>
        <code>

        // declare new JavaScript object literal
        var majorCities = {
          japan: "Tokyo"
          taiwan: "Taipei"
          unitedStates: "San Francisco",
          france: "Paris",
          england: "London",
        };

        // access JavaScript object value
        majorCities["taiwan"]; // => "Taipei"
        majorCities["china"];  // => undefined

        // modify value
        majorCities["unitedStates"] = "New York";

        // add new property/value
        majorCities["spain"] = "Barcelona";

        // delete existing property/value
        delete majorCities["england"];

        // output
        console.log(majorCities);
        /*
        =>
        { japan: "Tokyo",
          taiwan: "Taipei",
          unitedStates: "New York",
          france: "Paris",
          spain: "Barcelona" }
        */

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p><em>Ruby Hash Literal:</em></p>
      <pre>
        <code>

        # declare new Ruby Hash literal
        major_cities = {
          japan: "Tokyo"
          taiwan: "Taipei"
          united_states: "San Francisco",
          france: "Paris",
          england: "London",
        }

        # access Ruby hash value
        major_cities[:taiwan]; # => "Taipei"
        major_cities[:china];  # => nil

        # modify value
        major_cities[:united_states] = "New York"

        # add new key/value
        major_cities[:spain] = "Barcelona"

        # delete existing key/value
        major_cities.delete(:england)

        # output
        puts major_cities;
        =begin
        =>
        {:japan=>"Tokyo", :taiwan+>"Taipei", :united_states=>"New York",
        :france=>"Paris", :spain=>"Barcelona"}
        =end

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        We can see that there are many similarities between how a JavaScript object literal works and how a Ruby Hash literal works. The declaration, modification, and addition/subtraction of an element are handled in a very similar fashion aside from some stylistic syntax differences. I should note that I only show the bracket notation to access and modify JavaScript object literal above. This can also be done in a dot notation i.e. <code>majorCitiies.unitedStates = "San Francisco";</code>, it just depends on your preference. So the next time you're working in JavaScript and want to implement a hash-like structure (or vice-versa) just remember that object literals work in a similar fashion and you should be able to figure things out easily from there.
