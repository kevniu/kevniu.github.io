What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Padding is the space between the content and the border. Margin is the space between the border and the next element.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Static is the default type of positioning, these elements will stack in natural one-after another order. Relative positoning moves an element from the positoin it would be in normal flow, and shifting it from where it would've been placed. Fixed positioning means that the elements stays on the same area of the page, relative to the browser window. Absolute positioning allows you to move that object anywhere on the page. It's taken out of normal flow so it does not affect any other element on the page.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest things to implement were probably the stylistics elements, everything can be controlled easily with the use of classes and ids. The most difficult aspect for me, is still figuring out the use positioning for making the header and footer to position them where I want them.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I definitely saw the benefits of formatting with CSS on this challenge. You can create just one CSS page so that all your similar elements across your web pages will be styled with the same properties. Classes and ids are useful when you need to target certain elements of your page.
